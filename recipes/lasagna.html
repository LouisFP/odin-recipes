        <h3>Description</h3>
        Lasagna is a dish originating from Italy which involves, traditionally, the cooking of a sauce with lamb or beef and a b&eacute;chamel sauce. The dish is then constructed via alternating layers of lasagna 
        pasta and the aforementioned sauce with perhaps a layer of b&eacute;chamel sauce in the middle, if there is enough, and then finished by one more layer of b&eacute;chamel sauce.
        However, the vegan version is a bit different, of course.
